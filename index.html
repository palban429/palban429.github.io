		<h4 class= "intro">Hey pals! My name is Paola Alban. I am 17 years old and live in Richmond Ca. I was born in Lima, Peru on April 18, 1999. Currently I am an incoming senior at Middle College High School located in Contra Costa College in San Pablo Ca. My high school isn't like any other regular high school, we only have about 250 kids at our school and we are allowed to take college classes. It's a great school! Well, enough about school. On the weekends, in the mornings I'm usually at the restaurant "Sunny Side Up," in Albany Ca. I work there as a hostess. Other than work and school, I usually spend a lot of time with my friends and/or family. My family loves to throw parties and there's usually a lot of dancing involved, which would explain my love for all types of dance. I can be a very out going person but also pretty shy at times. Once you begin speaking to me though, I believe I'm pretty easy to talk to. If there's anything more you guys would like to know, don't be scared to hit me up!! Bye guys :-)</h4>
